## About Me

What brought me to the University of Utah?
To be specific, the Entertainment Arts & Engineering (EAE) program. I grew up in Utah and found that being a resident made it easier to attend college. Coming from the realization that I'll be a first-generation college graduate when I get my Bachelors in Computer Science with an emphasis in Games. For me, the chance to attend the University of Utah was too great an opportunity to pass up.

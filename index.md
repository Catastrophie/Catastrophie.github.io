## About Me

What brought me to the University of Utah?
```markdown
To be specific, the Entertainment Arts & Engineering (EAE) program.
I grew up in Utah and found that being a resident made it easier to attend college. 
Coming from the realization that I'll be a first-generation college graduate when 
I get my Bachelors in Computer Science with an emphasis in Games. 

For me, the chance to attend the University of Utah was too great an opportunity to pass up.

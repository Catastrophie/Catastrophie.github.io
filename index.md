### About Me

<img src= "CurrentPic.jpg" width="150"> 

Hiya! My name is Crystal, nice to meet you! 

I recently completed my Bachelor in Computer Science with a Games emphasis from the University of Utah. 
What this means for you: I've had a fair amount of experience working with many of my peers in a variety of different-sized teams or even solo! In these different groups, I've had the opportunity to fulfill many different roles. I'm not one for saying that's not my job, I'd rather learn something new and bring that new asset to the team over waiting for someone else to possibly step up if they aren't willing to. That's why my skills seem all over the place.

My skill isn't limited to my school education. Most recently, I was employed as an Associate Software Engineer at High Moon Studios. While there, I was given the amazingly unique experience of working on the AAA game, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, and 3, as well as mobile. While this was a short experience, it allowed me to grow tremendously as a software dev in both working on a live product with multiple teams, as well as owning my own feature work from the start and on through the lifetime of the feature.

I've also been employed as a Network research and monitoring intern with the Center for High-Performance Computing between the years 2016 to 2022. With this experience, I've had the opportunity to learn many skills relevant to my career as a Software Programmer. Many of these skills involve monitoring and automating data, as well as basic network processes. Within the scope of this job, I've experienced working within a team structure as well as alongside my peers to create a working product for users.

### About Me

<img src= "CurrentPic.jpg" width="150"> 

Hiya! My names Crystal, nice to meet you! 

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science with the Games emphasis. 
What this means for you: I've had a fair amount of experience working with many 
of my peers in a variety of different-sized teams or solo! In these 
different groups, I've had the opportunity to fulfill many different roles. I'm 
not one for saying that's not my job, I'd rather learn something new and bring that
new asset to the team, than wait for someone else to possibly step up if they aren't
willing to. That's why my skills seem all over the place.
